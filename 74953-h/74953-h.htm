<h1>The RADIO GHOST</h1>

<div class='bq mt10 mb10'>
<p class='ni it fs09 mb05'>This remarkable story, made so principally by the
fact that radio enters into it, is one of the most ingenious we have ever
read. The best part about the story, however, is that the radio principles
throughout the story are quite accurate. There is nothing fantastic about it,
and the thing can be duplicated by any good radio man today. Here, then,
is a scientifiction story, thrilling,
mysterious, and breathtaking, that we know you will enjoy.</p>

  “...As I bent over to examine the spot, I heard a cry of warning from the girl
  and a quick movement behind me. I turned, but could not move in time to avoid
  the heavy chair which was rushing toward me. It knocked me over and came back,
  apparently bent on my destruction.”

<p class='ni'>Dr. Dorp looked up in annoyance when Mrs. Bream came into the
room. As was my weekly custom, I had dropped into his study for a short
Saturday afternoon’s visit, and the talk had turned to our mutual hobby,
psychic phenomena. The learned doctor’s look of vexation had followed the
unobtrusive entrance of his housekeeper during a somewhat heated discussion of
that physically elusive but psychologically evident substance which has come
to be known as ectoplasm.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mrs. Bream?” he asked, petulantly.</p>

<p>“Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but there’s a young lady to see you.”</p>

<p>“What is she selling?”</p>

<p>“I believe she wants to consult you professionally, sir.”</p>

<p>“Like the book agent who called Wednesday, I suppose. Wanted my opinion of the
twelve volumes he was peddling. Well, show her in. We’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>I rose to leave the room, but the doctor raised his hand.</p>

<p>“Keep your seat, Evans,” he said. “I don’t expect this interview to be either
important or protracted.”</p>

<p>I resumed my seat, but rose again immediately as a neatly dressed girl entered
the room. She was small, golden-haired, and quite pretty. For a moment she
glanced at both of us, standing beside our chairs&mdash;then evidently decided in
favor of the doctor’s grizzled Van Dyke.</p>

<p>“I am Greta Van Loan, doctor,” she said, addressing him as if sure she had
spoken to the right man.</p>

<p>“You recognize me, then?” he asked, drawing a chair forward for her.</p>

<p>She sat down lightly, and with exquisite grace.</p>

<p>“To be sure. I have seen your picture in the papers ever so many times,
usually in connection with your investigations of spiritistic phenomena.”</p>

<p>The doctor did not appear to feel flattered. In fact, his look was rather one
of boredom, as if he expected something unpleasant to grow out of this subtle
blandishment. His voice, however, was quite pleasant as he replied.</p>

<p>“Indeed. Will you tell me how I may be of service to you?”</p>

<p>She looked at me, and I developed a most unnecessary feeling. I rose once
more, this time firmly resolved to take my leave, but again the doctor
detained me.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Loan,” he said, “allow me to present Mr. Evans, my friend and
colleague. Like me, he is an investigator of the supernormal in psychic
phenomena.”</p>

<p>Her acknowledgment of the introduction was accompanied by a charming smile
that immediately put me at my ease.</p>

<p>“I have heard of your work in connection with that of Dr. Dorp,” she said.
“How fortunate that I find you two together&mdash;especially as my reason for coming
to see the doctor has a direct bearing on the very subject that seems to be of
interest to both of you. Won’t you stay?”</p>

<p>I relapsed once more into my chair.</p>

<p>The doctor, I observed, had pricked up his ears like a hound on a hot trail.
He leaned forward in his chair and pressed the tips of his fingers together&mdash;an
attitude he always assumed when absorbed in a problem that was of intense
interest to him.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Loan,” he began, “you are not by any chance a relative of my old
friend and fellow worker, Gordon Van Loan?”</p>

<p>“I am his niece.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. I begin to understand your interest in spiritistic phenomena. Dense
of me not to have thought of it before.”</p>

<p>“But, doctor, I am not interested in spiritistic phenomena.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Not interested? I’m afraid I don’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have always feared and detested the very thought of meeting or
communicating with the disembodied spirits.”</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Van Loan, you surprise me,” said the doctor. “Your uncle, up to
the very time of his death, was an ardent supporter of the spiritistic
hypothesis. I have had many a private debate with him on the subject.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that. I, too, have argued the subject with him when it was
forced on me. Until three days ago I was as firm an unbeliever as you. But
now&mdash;I don’t know what to think. It seems that my uncle, even in death, has
resolved to force his belief upon me.”</p>

<p>“You mean that he has appeared to you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, but strange things&mdash;terrible, enervating things&mdash;have happened
since I began to carry out the provisions of my uncle’s will.”</p>

<p>“He left his entire fortune to you, did he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but with a provision which I am afraid I won’t be able to carry out. He
stipulated that I must live in his old home in Highland Park continuously for
one year, and that if I should fail to do so everything would revert to my
cousin, Ernest Hegel, or in the event of his failure to carry out the
provision, to the Society for Psychical Research.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle was reputed to be quite wealthy.”</p>

<p>“He left something over half a million, most of which was in first mortgage
real estate bonds, in addition to the home and estate, which is estimated to
be worth at least a hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“Quite a sizeable bequest, and, it seems to me, an ample recompense for the
condition imposed with it.”</p>

<p>“So I thought too, until I spent a night in that awful house. It was then that
I began to realize the full import of his explanation of the reasons for his
unusual provision.”</p>

<p>“Just what was his explanation?”</p>

<p>“I can give you his exact words. In the last three days they have burned
themselves into my very soul. He said: ‘&mdash;for when I return to prove the
reality of life after death it is not unreasonable to ask the person who
benefits so materially by this will to be on hand to greet me, and to receive
and transmit my message of hope and good cheer to the misguided scoffers, who,
by their very attitude, prevent their departed loved ones from communicating
with them.’”</p>

<p>“Hem. And have you received the message, or something purporting to be the
message?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but there have been indications of a strange and terrible
presence in that house&mdash;an elusive, disembodied entity that, while not a
creature of flesh and blood, exercises an uncanny power over material objects
as well as living creatures.”</p>

<p>“I see. And the manifestations?”</p>

<p>“Ghostly raps, shuffling footsteps in rooms that are untenanted, overturned
furniture and broken china, strange sickening odors suggestive of the dank
mustiness of the tomb, lights darkened and suddenly lighted again with no
evidence of switches or of fuses having been tampered with, the touch of cold
hands in the dark, doors opening and closing in the dead of night, the icy
breath&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The icy breath? What is that?”</p>

<p>“It is the most convincing evidence of my uncle’s presence in the house.
Although the last three days and nights have been exceptionally warm, even for
August, I have felt it, and the servants have felt it&mdash;a moving current of air
with a dank, charnel odor, as cold as a wind from the ice-bound Arctic circle.
As you are no doubt aware, my uncle was an ardent admirer of the famous
Italian medium, Eusapia Palladino. One of the most baffling manifestations
which she is said to have produced time and again in the presence of
investigating scientists, was the icy breath&mdash;a cold breeze that appeared to
come from her forehead when she was in a trance. Many scoffed, but none could
explain this remarkable phenomenon. My uncle often referred to it in his
lectures. He has written several papers regarding it for spiritistic
publications.”</p>

<p>“And living creatures, you say, have been affected?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sandy, my Airedale terrier, has not been himself since he entered the
house. He has bristled and growled repeatedly, for no apparent reason.
Although he has always been a most friendly and playful pet, he now slinks
about the house like some vicious creature of the jungle, or mopes in corners,
avoiding all human companionship and barely tasting food and water. This
morning he snapped at my hand when I attempted to pat his head&mdash;something he
has never done before. The servants, too, have seen, heard, and felt the things
that have affected me, but being spiritualists, they glory in them rather than
fear them. Man and wife they have worked for my uncle for the past ten years,
the man acting as gardener, chauffeur and butler, the woman as cook and
housekeeper.”</p>

<p>“And your cousin, Ernest Hegel. Is he, too, stopping with you at present?”</p>

<p>“No. Cousin Ernest sailed for Germany last Saturday. He is American
representative for a Berlin dye and chemical manufacturer, and was sent for by
his concern.”</p>

<p>“Then he is a German citizen?”</p>

<p>“His father was German, but he was born in America, hence he is an American
citizen. His mother, like my father and Uncle Gordon, was American, of Holland
Dutch descent. Part of his education was received at Heidelberg, and he took a
postgraduate course in chemistry and bacteriology in Vienna. When the war
broke out, his sympathy for the land of his father was what turned my uncle
against him.”</p>

<p>“And consequently made you the preferred heir?”</p>

<p>“I think that has something to do with it, although I disagreed as thoroughly
with Uncle Gordon in his pet hobby, spiritism, as Ernest did on questions of
our international relations.”</p>

<p>“Do any of the manifestations you speak of occur in the daytime?”</p>

<p>“None, except the queer behavior of my dog.”</p>

<p>“Hem. You have stated a very interesting case, Miss Van Loan. I, for one, will
be very glad to investigate the phenomena which have been troubling you.”</p>

<p>“And I will be glad to go, too, if you want me,” I said.</p>

<p>The young lady seemed pleased.</p>

<p>“I hope that I may have the help of both of you&mdash;and soon,” she said earnestly.</p>

<p>The doctor turned to me.</p>

<p>“How about going this evening?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Suits me.”</p>

<p>“Good. We can drive out easily in an hour. You may expect us about dusk, Miss
Loan.”</p>

<p>“You know the address?”</p>

<p>“I have visited your uncle several times, and he has also been my guest here.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I have heard Uncle Gordon speak of you. Goodby, until dusk&mdash;and
thank you, much...”</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>Our drive, that evening, through the red-gold light of the
waning afternoon, was both pleasant and uneventful. After a sultry day in the
loop, it was refreshing to ride through the cool, tree-shaded north shore
suburbs. Dr. Dorp, as was his wont when on the trail of a new mystery, was in
the best of spirits&mdash;laughing and chatting gaily.</p>

<p>We arrived in Highland Park just at dusk, and presently turned into a narrow
driveway which circled through a heavily wooded estate. At first no house was
visible, but presently, as we wound through the darkest and gloomiest copse we
had yet encountered, it came unexpectedly into view&mdash;an ancient brick homestead
of the Dutch Colonial type, with gables that drooped despondently, and
chimneys surmounted by double tiles that stood out against the background of
gray sky like headless torsos with arms upraised to heaven.</p>

<p>As we drew up before the entrance, the noise of the doctor’s motor ceased, and
from just beyond the background of trees, there came a throbbing, pulsating
murmur which had not previously been audible to us, announcing the proximity
of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we set foot on the porch, when the door opened silently and a
gray haired, white jacketed man with burning gray eyes that looked out from
hollow recesses in a pale, wrinkled, and cadaverous countenance, stood aside,
hand on latch, for us to enter. So loathsome in appearance was this deathlike
creature that I had a feeling of repugnance even at the thought of permitting
him to take my hat in his bony, claw-like hands.</p>

<p>After disposing of our hats, he conducted us to a commodious living room,
tastily furnished, where we were greeted by our charming hostess. Then he
silently withdrew, closing the door after him.</p>

<p>Although she maintained a brave, calm demeanor, I noticed that the hand of
Miss Van Loan was trembling as I took it in mine. The doctor, also, must have
noticed this, for he quickly transferred his long, slim fingers to her pulse.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” he asked consulting his watch.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet, but I have been oppressed by a horrible feeling which I cannot
explain. I have worried, too, for fear something might prevent your coming.”</p>

<p>“You are a very brave young woman,” he said, pocketing his watch and releasing
her wrist, “but you have been under exceptionally severe nervous strain. Just
now you are beginning to feel the reaction. Your heart, however, is good, and
I believe another night of it can do you no permanent injury. Were this not
the case, I should advise you to immediately leave this house, despite the
tremendous financial stake involved.”</p>

<p>“But, doctor, do you think the&mdash;the presence, can be driven out in one night?”</p>

<p>“That is my hope. I have a theory&mdash;”</p>

<p>His speech was suddenly interrupted by a noisy rattling of the doorknob&mdash;the
very door which the servant had silently closed a few minutes before.</p>

<p>“It is coming!” said the girl breathlessly, a note of terror in her voice.</p>

<p>The three of us watched the door silently&mdash;intently. It opened, revealing the
dimly lighted hallway, in which no living creature was visible. For a moment
it remained open as if someone were standing there with a hand on the knob.
Then it closed with a bang.</p>

<p>I felt a prickly sensation in my scalp, then started from my tracks at the
sound of a throaty rumble behind me.</p>

<p>“That is Sandy, my Airedale,” explained the girl, “hiding in the corner behind
the davenport. He always growls when it comes.”</p>

<p>“I believe he scared me worse than _it_,” I said with a nervous laugh, sinking
back on the davenport, relieved by the realization that the noise, at least,
had been earthly.</p>

<p>“It is now in the room,” said the girl. “Don’t you feel a strange presence?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the doctor gravely.</p>

<p>We waited breathlessly for the next manifestation. For several minutes the
only sounds I could hear were those which drifted through the two open
windows, one on each side of the fireplace&mdash;the clatter of frogs, the piping of
nocturnal insects, the incessant muffled roar of the surf on the beach, and
the occasional call of a night bird. Then a heavy poker, which had been
leaning against the fireplace, clattered to the tiles, slid across them, and
progressed with a queer jerky motion across the rug to the center of the room.
It remained there for a moment, then twirled around and came straight toward
me, still with the same jerky motion. When it seemed about to strike my feet I
drew them up, half-expecting the thing to leap at me.</p>

<p>Despite this singular and, to me, inexplicable phenomenon, Dr. Dorp
maintained, unruffled, his look of complete absorption. The girl, however, was
manifestly alarmed.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Mr. Evans,” she said tensely. “I’m afraid it may hurt you.”</p>

<p>Somehow I did not want to appear cowardly in the eyes of this girl. The heavy
poker which had performed such amazing antics now lay quiescent, and
apparently quite harmless, at my feet.</p>

<p>Simulating a calmness which I was far from feeling, I bent over and picked the
thing up. I was examining it minutely, half-expecting to find some mechanical
attachment which would prove the whole thing a hoax, when it was suddenly and
forcibly jerked from my grasp. It thumped to the floor, then spun half around
and traveled jerkily back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>“What made you drop it?” asked the doctor. “Wasn’t hot, was it?”</p>

<p>When I told him that it had been jerked from my hands, he seemed surprised.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you didn’t just drop it from&mdash;ah&mdash;nervousness?”</p>

<p>“Positive.”</p>

<p>“Hem. Strange.”</p>

<p>We sat for several minutes without incident. Then I noticed that the lights
were growing dim. I concentrated my gaze on the filaments of the reading lamp
beside me. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, they were losing their incandescence.</p>

<p>Presently the room was in darkness, save for the dim twilight which came
through the two windows. I could barely discern the figures of my two
companions, blending with the shadowy outlines of the chairs in which they
sat. A strange, musty odor assailed my nostrils. I felt a cold touch on the
back of my hand, and automatically jerked it away. Then a breeze, icy cold,
chilled me to the marrow. The dog growled ominously.</p>

<p>A light thud, as if some object had fallen, attracted my attention to the
center of the room. Scarcely crediting the evidence of my senses, I saw a
pale, luminous figure rising from the floor. The thing was irregular in
outline, and swayed this way and that as if wafted by eddying air currents.
Taller and taller it grew, until, when it had reached a height of nearly six
feet, it bore some resemblance to a human figure shrouded in a white, filmy
material.</p>

<p>Although my flesh crept and chills chased each other up and down my spine, I
remembered that I was here to investigate this thing, and rising, forced
myself to walk stealthily toward the center of the room. As I approached the
grim wraith it grew taller, towering menacingly above me, and a queer,
sickening odor became momentarily stronger&mdash;an odor which might have been
produced by a combination of the fumes of brimstone with the offensive
effluvium of putrefying flesh.</p>

<p>By the time I was within two feet of the thing I was nearly strangled by its
horrible stench, but I had made up my mind to test its solidity at last, and
stretched out my hand to touch it. The hand encountered no resistance. Moving
it horizontally, I passed my hand clear through it from side to side. By this
time my eyes were watering so badly from the effect of the acrid fumes that I
was scarcely able to see. Then the lights flashed on, completely blinding me
for a moment with their brilliance. A moment later I was able to see clearly.</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>A cry from Dr. Dorp aroused me.</p>

<p>“Quick, Evans,” he said, ”the girl has fainted. We must get her into the open
air.”</p>

<p>He was endeavoring to lift her himself, but found her weight too much for him.
Being his junior by some thirty-five years and of a rather more substantial
build, I found her slight form no burden whatever.</p>

<p>“Open the doors, doctor,” I said. “I’ll do the rest.”</p>

<p>I had lifted the girl from the chair, and was turning toward the door, the
doctor meanwhile advancing to open it. Before he could do so, however, the
latch rattled, and the door swung open by itself. Quick as a flash, the doctor
sprang out into the hall, peering this way and that.</p>

<p>“Nobody here,” he said. “Come on.”</p>

<p>I followed him down the hallway, this time close at his heels, with the girl
still lying limply in my arms. He extended his hand, about to open the door
which led to the front porch, when the knob turned, and this second door was
opened as if by some invisible presence. Once more the doctor sprang forward,
only to find the porch untenanted.</p>

<p>I laid the still unconscious girl in the porch swing, at the behest of the
doctor, who informed me that she would regain consciousness more quickly in a
reclining position.</p>

<p>“Now fan her with this magazine, Evans,” he instructed, handing me a copy of
“_Science and Invention_” which he had taken from the porch table. He felt her
pulse for a moment. “She’ll be all right in a few minutes. I’m going back to
that room and have a look around. Keep fanning until she is fully revived.”</p>

<p>Interested as I was in the phenomena which were taking place, I was glad of
this brief respite and a chance to inhale some fresh air. The girl,
unconscious, was free from the sway of fear for the time being, and I knew
from the reassuring manner of the doctor that she was in no danger. While I
continued to ply the improvised fan I could hear the doctor, or someone,
moving about the house.</p>

<p>Presently the girl’s eyelids fluttered, and she began talking&mdash;her words
disconnected and broken like those of one in a dream.</p>

<p>“Saw it&mdash;saw&mdash;spirit&mdash;Uncle Gordon. Must be&mdash;be his&mdash;ghost. Saw&mdash;put arm&mdash;through
it.”</p>

<p>Lightly I placed my hand on the smooth, cool forehead. Then she opened her
eyes and looked earnestly into mine.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what was I saying?” she asked, apparently quite bewildered.</p>

<p>“You fainted,” I replied. “Don’t worry. Everything is all right.”</p>

<p>“But where is Dr. Dorp?”</p>

<p>“Just went in the house to look around. He’ll be out in a few minutes, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>We waited a full twenty minutes, but still the doctor did not appear. Miss Van
Loan had taken one of the wicker porch chairs, assuring me that she had fully
recovered. I was sitting in another. All sounds in the house had ceased, and I
began to feel some apprehension for the doctor’s safety.</p>

<p>“Do you mind staying alone for a few minutes?” I asked. “I should like to go
and see if my friend is all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” she replied, rising.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you are strong enough?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Oh, I do hope nothing happened to him. I should never forgive myself.”</p>

<p>We met the pale houseman in the hall.</p>

<p>“Where is the doctor, Riggs?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, ma’am. I heard someone goin’ up the stairs a while ago. Might
have been him.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen him?”</p>

<p>“No ma’am. I come in just now to ask if you would be a-needin’ of me any more
this evenin’. I feel sort of tired like, after&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know, Riggs. You haven’t had much rest for the last three nights. You may
go.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am.”</p>

<p>We ascended the stairs, the steps of which creaked weirdly under our weight. I
could readily understand why Riggs had been able to hear them from the service
quarters.</p>

<p>At the top was a long hallway with a door at one end, a window at the other,
and two doors on either side.</p>

<p>Miss Van Loan opened the first door at our right, and we entered a bedroom
daintily furnished in cane and ivory, with light blue hangings and spreads.</p>

<p>“This is my room,” she informed me. “We have four bedrooms, each with a
private bath and clothes closet.”</p>

<p>I looked into the bath and clothes closet, but both were untenanted. Then we
passed to the next room. This was furnished in burled walnut, with light green
the prevailing color. No sign of the doctor here. The next room, which was
just across the hall, was furnished in massive oak, with a taupe and maroon
color scheme. Somehow it seemed thoroughly a man’s room.</p>

<p>“This belonged to Uncle Gordon,” said the girl. “It was in that bed that he
died.”</p>

<p>I looked at the bed and somehow the gray and maroon of the bolster and spread
reminded me of blood trickling over a sacrificial slab of granite. With this
thought came an inexplicable feeling of horror which I could not shake off.</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>“It is back!” said the girl, suddenly, a note of terror in her
voice.</p>

<p>She must have had the same feeling as I, at the same time, although nothing
startling had happened&mdash;at least nothing that either of us could perceive with
the aid of our five senses. The bathroom was empty, and I had started for the
door of the closet, when the lights suddenly went out. Once more I was
conscious of the peculiar, dusty odor I had detected in the room below. The
girl shrieked. Then as if in answer to her cry, I heard a hollow groan and
five distinct raps, apparently coming from the direction of the bed.</p>

<p>The door of the closet which I had not searched was not more than a foot from
the head of the bed. I could still see it, though indistinctly, by the dim,
gray light which came in through the window. Although I am not superstitious,
a nameless dread assailed me at the thought of approaching nearer to that bed
in which the former owner of the house had breathed his last. I hesitated,
berating myself for a coward and weakling&mdash;then forced myself toward the door.</p>

<p>As I did so, I heard more raps, not quite so pronounced as formerly, then
another moan, and sounds like those of a person gasping for breath. On
reaching the door, I turned the knob, but found it locked. Then my fingers
touched a key just below it. I turned this with difficulty. It seemed that
either the lock was stuck, or something was resisting my efforts. Releasing
the key, I once more attempted to open the door. Before I could turn the knob,
however, the door again locked itself. From somewhere nearby, I heard a sound
which plainly resembled the death rattle!</p>

<p>Once more I succeeded in unlocking the door, although the key was bent in the
process. Then, holding the key with my left hand, I turned the knob with my
right, and applied my shoulder to the door. Someone, or some thing, was
pushing against it on the other side. At first I only succeeded in moving it a
fraction of an inch. Gathering my strength for a supreme effort, I forced it
wide open. As I did so, a rush of icy cold air enveloped me from head to foot.
Hot and perspiring from my exertions as I was, it chilled me to the marrow. My
teeth chattered, and I shivered as if I had suddenly been immersed in ice-water.</p>

<p>Within the closet, all was black, as no light reached it from the window.
Holding one foot against the door, which was still resisting my efforts, I
lighted a match. It went out almost as soon as I struck it, but I had seen
enough. Beneath a mound of clothing, evidently snatched from the hooks on the
wall, lay a human figure.</p>

<p>Stooping, I succeeded in grasping a foot and ankle. Then I dragged the body
with its accompanying mound of clothing, from the closet. By this time my
fingers were so numbed with cold that I could scarcely use them. I took my
foot from the door, and it closed with a vicious bang.</p>

<p>Miss Van Loan had apparently recovered, in some measure, from her fit of
terror, for she came up beside me.</p>

<p>“What is it? What did you find in the closet?” she whispered, peering at the
shapeless thing which lay there in the dim, gray light.</p>

<p>Without taking time to reply, I hastily removed the pile of miscellaneous
clothing from the body. Then my hand touched a cold forehead&mdash;a hairy face.</p>

<p>“Open the door, quickly!” I ordered. “My God, I’m afraid we have come too
late.”</p>

<p>She promptly did as she was bidden, while I gathered the cold, still form of
Dr. Dorp in my arms. Then I staggered out of the room, across the hall, down
the creaking stairway, and out upon the porch, the girl following. As I laid
the doctor in the swing where I had deposited the mistress of the house less
than an hour before, the lights flashed on once more.</p>

<p>“Rouse the servants,” I said. “Telephone for a doctor. Then bring hot water,
towels, blankets, hot-water bottles&mdash;and some brandy.”</p>

<p>While she was gone, I alternately slapped, kneaded and rubbed the cold flesh
of my friend. She returned in a few minutes that seemed like hours, with two
hot water bottles and an armful of towels. Behind her toddled a stout,
round-faced woman in a red kimono, with a steaming kettle of water in one hand
and a bottle and glass in the other.</p>

<p>We applied the various articles with better will than skill, and a moment
later Riggs appeared in bathrobe and slippers carrying four thick woolen
blankets. Another ten minutes elapsed before we succeeded in even warming the
flesh of our patient.</p>

<p>“We haven’t any brandy, so I brought a bottle of Uncle Gordon’s whiskey,” said
the girl. “Do you think we had better give him some?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” I replied. “It might strangle him if he has enough life left in him
to strangle.”</p>

<p>The rumble of a motor sounded in the driveway, and two bright headlights
flashed on the porch. A coupe pulled up with shrieking brakes and a young man,
carrying a small satchel, got out and dashed up the steps.</p>

<p>“This way, Dr. Graves,” called the girl, beckoning him to the swing where my
friend lay.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Dr. Dorp!” said the young physician, taking the pulse of my friend.
“What happened to him?”</p>

<p>“Asphyxiation,” I replied, “and exposure to extreme cold.”</p>

<p>Dr. Graves took a stethoscope from his case and used it for a few moments.</p>

<p>“The doctor has sustained quite a severe shock,” he said, “but he is doing
nicely now. There is nothing I can give him or do for him at this stage which
will help matters. Fresh air and warmth are our best allies now.”</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>My friend regained consciousness five minutes later. He
immediately recognized Dr. Graves, who had attended a number of his lectures
before members of the medical fraternity, and had entered into discussions
with him.</p>

<p>While the two were talking, the housekeeper went in for some hot water, lemon
and sugar for a toddy. She had only been absent for a few minutes when we were
all alarmed by the sound of barking and snarling within the house, punctuated
by piercing screams.</p>

<p>Dr. Graves was the first to reach the door, where he paused. I attempted to
force my way past him, but he stayed me with his arm.</p>

<p>“Get back, woman!” he shouted to someone within. “Get back and close the door.
The creature is mad.”</p>

<p>At the far end of the hall, I saw the stout wife of the house man apparently
rooted to the floor by horror. Just in front of her, the Airedale, growling
and snarling savagely, was rapidly demolishing the upholstering of a beautiful
antique settee. The hairy jaws of the creature were flecked with white foam,
and the eyes were bloodshot and unnaturally luminescent from extreme dilation
of the pupils.</p>

<p>Seeing the peril in which the poor woman was placed, I caught up one of the
porch chairs and rushed past the doctor. The dog took no notice of me until I
swung at it with the chair. Then it dodged with surprising dexterity and
leaped for my throat, just as two of the chair legs were shattered against the
floor. I managed to elude it by quickly crouching behind the chair back, so
that it passed clear over my head.</p>

<p>It was up again in an instant, however, and I had all I could do to protect
myself from its leaps by fencing with the remains of the chair. Almost before
I was aware of it, the beast had backed me into the living room. Then, to my
horror, the door closed, and the lights winked out.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the battle I fought in that dark room. That which had
been a shaggy creature of flesh and bone in the light, had become a pair of
burning orbs, set in a shadowy form, that leaped, snapped, and snarled in a
manner which was twice as terrifying as its former attacks had been when each
move was completely visible. Now I was guided only by the movements of the
luminous eyes, whereas I had previously been able to forecast each hostile
move or leap by the crouch or muscular tension which preceded it.</p>

<p>Using the chair as a shield, I eventually managed to circle back to the door.
With one hand I attempted to turn the knob, while I manipulated the chair with
the other. The door was locked. I immediately felt below for the key,
recalling that it had been there earlier in the evening. It was gone!</p>

<p>My canine adversary made a determined leap that forced me to one side. Then
some one pounded on the door, and I heard the voice of Dr. Graves.</p>

<p>“Unlock the door, Mr. Evans. I have a gun and electric torch.”</p>

<p>“There is no key on this side,” I replied. Then I caught a glimpse of a light
flashing through the keyhole and wondered what had become of the key.</p>

<p>“It must have fallen to the floor on that side,” said the young doctor. “I
cannot find it in the hall.”</p>

<p>I again succeeded in maneuvering to a position in front of the door. Then I
tramped about in front of it until my shoe struck a hard object. Stooping, I
picked it up, and rejoiced to find that the doctor had been right. Again using
one hand to manipulate the chair, I inserted the key in the lock and managed
to turn it, though with considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>“Turn the knob,” I shouted, “and push.”</p>

<p>The knob turned, and the door opened behind me. A beam of light shot past me,
for a moment illuminating the hairy face and dripping fangs of the brute. Then
a shot rang out, the light faded from the luminous eyes, and the beast sank
slowly to the floor, blood gushing from its mouth and nostrils.</p>

<p>“Good shot, doctor,” I said, turning and releasing my hold on the battered
chair. To my surprise I saw Miss Van Loan holding the flashlight in one hand
and a smoking pistol in the other, while great tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“You!” I cried.</p>

<p>“I was holding these while the doctor went for a ladder,” she said. “He was
going to try to help you by climbing up to the window. Then I heard you call.
Poor Sandy.”</p>

<p>“Too bad you had to kill your pet,” I replied, closing the door and relieving
her of gun and torch.</p>

<p>“W&mdash;wasn’t it horrible?” she sobbed. “B-but I had to do it. He might have
k-killed you.”</p>

<p>I was about to thank her for having saved my life when the young doctor
suddenly came up from the basement, dragging a stepladder. Seeing us standing
there in the hall, he laid it down and joined us.</p>

<p>“You have been rescued, I see,” he said.</p>

<p>“Most bravely,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Did the beast bite or scratch you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? Sometimes a wound goes unnoticed in the heat of combat. Perhaps
I had better look you over. I am reasonably sure the dog had hydrophobia.”</p>

<p>He forthwith examined me with the aid of the flashlight. I had not known it
before, but my left coat sleeve was torn, and my arm was bleeding where the
sharp fangs had raked it.</p>

<p>“Infected,” he said, “and of course I have no serum with me. Come out on the
porch.”</p>

<p>On the porch, he made a ligature with a towel and a pair of long scissors.
Then he took a bottle and some cotton from his case and drenched the wounds
with silver nitrate.</p>

<p>“Better come to the hospital with me at once for a serum treatment,” he
advised. “It may save your life.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t leave my friends&mdash;&mdash;” I began.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” interrupted Dr. Dorp, who was sitting up, although still muffled
in a blanket. “Miss Van Loan and I will be all right here on the porch until
you get back.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the girl. “You have put your life in sufficient jeopardy as
it is, Mr. Evans.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, I got into the coupe with the young doctor, and we set out
for the hospital.</p>

<p>“Queer thing the way that door shut and locked itself,” he said, when we
emerged on the smooth paving of Sheridan Road. “The key must have been half
turned in the lock when the wind blew it shut. The jar locked it and shook out
the key.”</p>

<p>Although I did not feel that his explanation of the phenomenon was a true one,
I decided not to debate the matter with him, as it was evident that Miss Van
Loan did not want it known among her acquaintances that there were strange
goings-on in her home.</p>

<p>“It was odd,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“Too bad that the lights had to go out just when they did, too,” he went on.
“A most unfortunate coincidence.”</p>

<p>“It was,” I said, with mental reservations.</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>An hour later at the hospital, my wound was dressed and a
considerable quantity of serum injected into my bloodstream. Then I called a
cab which got me back to my friends shortly after midnight.</p>

<p>I found Dr. Dorp dozing in one of the porch chairs with a blanket around him,
and Miss Van Loan, completely exhausted, asleep in the swing.</p>

<p>“Better try to get some rest in one of these chairs,” said the doctor. “There
is nothing further we can do until morning.”</p>

<p>I was not loath to follow his suggestion, and soon drifted into a fitful,
dream-haunted slumber from which I did not thoroughly awaken until the
slanting rays of the morning sun struck me full in the face.</p>

<p>For a moment I sat there, blinking in the bright light, trying to remember
where I was. Then the sound of a low cough from the doorway caused me to turn.
I beheld the cadaverous face and angular form of Riggs.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Riggs.”</p>

<p>“Will you have your bath hot or cold, sir?”</p>

<p>“The colder the better.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>A few moments later I was shaving with a razor which Riggs informed me had
belonged to his late master, while a sizable column of cold water roared into
the tub. While I bathed and dressed, the houseman repaired the rent in my
sleeve. A half-hour afterward, feeling greatly rested and refreshed, I went
down to breakfast. Miss Van Loan met me in the dining room where places had
been laid for two.</p>

<p>“Dr. Dorp left early this morning for the city,” she informed me. “He asked me
to have you wait here until his return this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“He could not have set me a more pleasant task,” I replied, receiving my cup
of coffee from the hand of my charming hostess. “Did he mention what urgent
business took him to the city?”</p>

<p>“Something about some investigations he wished to make, and some paraphernalia
he would need for tonight,” she said. “He was in a great hurry. Wouldn’t even
stop for a bite of breakfast.”</p>

<p>“That is his way,” I replied, “when engrossed in a particularly interesting
investigation. He will probably neither eat nor drink until the mystery has
been solved.”</p>

<p>“And will that be soon?”</p>

<p>“I believe it will.”</p>

<p>“Just what is your opinion, Mr. Evans, of the things you saw last night?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” I replied, “that my opinion at this time is not of much value.
Frankly, I have been mystified. I have theories, of course, but they are,
after all, only theories.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe it was the ghost of Uncle Gordon that we saw in the living
room last night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in ghosts.”</p>

<p>“Then what was it? What could have caused it? What could have caused doors to
lock and unlock, to open and close without the touch of human hands? What
could have caused the intense cold&mdash;the poker to creep across the floor as if
it were alive? What drove my dog mad with fear?”</p>

<p>“The dog,” I replied, “showed symptoms of hydrophobia.”</p>

<p>“That is what Dr. Dorp thought, although he was not sure. He took the carcass
with him, wrapped in a sheet for examination.”</p>

<p>“Then his opinion confirms that of Dr. Graves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how poor Sandy could have gotten it,” she said. “He hasn’t been
near any other animal, and I understand he would have to be scratched or
bitten by one to become infected.”</p>

<p>“The examination will show whether or not he had hydrophobia, and I hope he
hadn’t,” I replied, “for a very personal reason. Just how he contracted it, of
course, may never be known.”</p>

<p>“For your sake, I too hope that he didn’t have it. You are in grave danger,
are you not, from that bite?”</p>

<p>“Not so bad as all that. A comparatively short time ago it was the equivalent
of a death warrant to be bitten by a rabid animal. Modern science, however,
has made death from hydrophobia a rarity when treatment is administered in
time.”</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>The remainder of the day was spent quite pleasantly, strolling
about the grounds and on the white, foam-edged beach, or lolling on the large,
conformable porch.</p>

<p>We had dinner at six, and I was enjoying a cigar in the swing shortly
thereafter, when I heard the throb of a motor in the driveway and the big car
of Dr. Dorp came into view.</p>

<p>He drove up to the curb, and I saw that he had four men with him. Each was
carrying a large package covered with khaki. The packages were placed on the
porch, and the doctor presented his four companions, as Mr. Easton, civil
engineer, Mr. Brandon, electrical engineer, and Messrs. Hogan and Rafferty,
detectives. At a sign from the doctor, the two detectives immediately strolled
out into the shrubbery.</p>

<p>“We’re going to make a few preparations for the show this evening,” he said,
addressing me. “Want to come along?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“All right. Each man grab a bundle. We haven’t much time before dark.”</p>

<p>I took up one of the khaki-wrapped packages, which was far from light, and
each other man did likewise. The doctor led the way around the house, and down
to the beach.</p>

<p>Directly behind the house we unwrapped two of the packages. One proved to be a
set of surveyor’s instruments which the civil engineer quickly assembled. The
other looked very much like a radio set with its loop aerials and dials,
although there was no speaker or headphone with it. The radio set was placed
on a small folding table, and Mr. Easton sighted from that point, while I
acted as roadman and Mr. Brandon as chainman. We measured off a distance of
two thousand feet in a straight line along the beach, the doctor following
with the other package. At that point, the other radio-like machine was
assembled and placed on a folding table. We left Mr. Brandon with this
machine, and went back to the first one.</p>

<p>“Now, Evans,” said my friend. “You and Mr. Easton go back to the house and
keep Miss Van Loan company. As soon as it begins to get dark go into the
living room and occupy the same positions as last night. Mr. Easton has a
false beard with him, and will be disguised to look like me. Caution Miss Van
Loan, when she is inside the house, to address Mr. Easton by my name. Do not,
under any circumstances, tell her this while you are in the house. When you
hear my motor racing outside, come out. Mr. Easton will remain. Rafferty will
then go in to take your place. Is everything clear?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>We found Miss Van Loan on the porch, and I whispered our plans to her while
Easton adjusted his whiskers. He was about the same build and height as the
doctor, and thus disguised, bore considerable resemblance to him.</p>

<p>We chatted on the porch until dusk, then went into the living room and took
our seats. Presently the door opened and closed as on the night before. Then
the lights went out. Hearing a rustling sound near the door, I looked, and saw
the gleaming print of a human foot forming on the carpet. In a moment another
had formed in front of it while the rustling sound continued. The first
footprint disappeared and a third formed in front of the second. It was as if
some invisible entity were walking toward the center of the room, leaving
luminous tracks which disappeared each time a foot was lifted.</p>

<p>The footprints stopped, and drew together, side by side, in the center of the
room. Then there was a slight thump, and a wispy form, similar to the one we
had seen the night before, began to materialize while the two footprints
slowly faded. The thing reached a height of more than six feet, wabbling this
way and that as if scarcely able to support its own weight, while the horrible
odor we had noticed the night before permeated the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lights flashed on, and the apparition disappeared. Noticing that
there was something glistening on the floor where the thing had stood, I went
over to investigate. There was a small pool of clear, foul-smelling liquid
rapidly soaking into the rug. As I bent over to examine it I heard a cry of
warning from the girl and a quick movement behind me. I turned, but could not
move in time to avoid the heavy chair which was rushing toward me. It knocked
me flat, fell over me, righted itself, and came back, apparently bent on my
destruction. I managed to roll out of its way and get to my feet, but it
promptly chased me to the davenport, behind which I took shelter.</p>

<p>“Holy mackerel!” exclaimed the pseudo Dr. Dorp.</p>

<p>The chair, apparently realizing that it was baffled, swung about and quickly
returned to its place in the corner.</p>

<p>The phenomena, thus far, including the materialization of the spectre, had
taken a little more than half an hour. I heard the sound for which I had been
listening&mdash;the roar of the doctor’s motor.</p>

<p>“A remarkable chair, doctor,” I said. “The thing rather fagged me. I think
I’ll step out on the porch for a breath of cool air.”</p>

<p>The door obligingly opened for me when I left the room. The front door,
however, was already open. Rafferty was standing on the porch.</p>

<p>“Go on down to the car,” he whispered. “The doctor’s waitin’ for you.”</p>

<p>I went, and climbed into the front seat beside the doctor. Detective Hogan was
in the back seat. We whirled away with moaning gears.</p>

<p>The doctor handed me a folded map.</p>

<p>“Open this, will you, Evans?” he requested. “Hold it beneath the dash light. I
don’t want to miss the road.”</p>

<p>I opened it, and found it was a detailed map of Lake County. A large triangle
had been traced on the paper, its smallest angle resting on a spot marked with
an X, apparently some eight miles due west of our present location.</p>

<p>“Does X mark the spot where the body was found?” I asked, as we spun around
onto Sheridan Road on two wheels.</p>

<p>“It marks the spot where I expect to find the source of Miss Van Loan’s
troubles,” replied the doctor. “It isn’t far, as the crow flies, but there is
no through road to it. We have a roundabout trip of about sixteen miles ahead
of us.”</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>We continued north on Sheridan Road for nearly four miles. Then
we swung west at Highwood, continuing in this direction for about eight miles.
Turning south on the Milwaukee road at Halfday, we covered another three miles
of road before the doctor slowed his terrific pace.</p>

<p>“Take the wheel now, will you?” he requested, “and drive slowly.”</p>

<p>We changed places, and I started off at a speed of about ten miles an hour.
The doctor lifted a small portable radio set from behind the back seat,
adjusted the tuning dials, and slowly moved the loop aerial back and forth
until there was an angry buzz from inside the machine. He then continued to
slowly turn the loop aerial as we moved along, apparently with the purpose of
keeping it in a position where the machine would buzz the loudest.</p>

<p>I noticed that, at first, the direction of the loop only made a very slight
deviation from the direction in which we were going. Gradually, however, the
deviation grew greater until the loop stood at right angles to our course. We
were, at the moment, passing the entrance to a lane, which led to a farmhouse
set back about half a mile from the road. As we continued past the lane the
aerial gradually straightened out toward our course.</p>

<p>About a thousand feet beyond the entrance to the lane was a brightly-lighted
filling station. We stopped there, left the car in charge of the service man,
and started across the fields. When we had gone a short distance, the doctor
handed me an automatic pistol.</p>

<p>“I hope we won’t have to do any shooting,” he said, “but it’s safer to be
prepared.”</p>

<p>It took us all of ten minutes to reach the farmhouse. It was in darkness,
except for one of the rear rooms, which was dimly lighted. Admonishing us to
tread carefully, the doctor led the way around the house. As we rounded the
rear porch, I saw that a four-wire aerial had been stretched between the gable
of the house and the barn. A wire connected to the aerial led down into the
dimly lighted rear room.</p>

<p>Instructing us to stay where we were, the doctor crept stealthily up on the
porch and peered through the window. For five minutes at least he stood there,
looking into that room while we waited below. Then he turned and beckoned to
us. Neither Hogan nor I lost any time in getting up to the window. I’m sure he
was as curious as I to learn what was going on in that room.</p>

<p>Seated on a long bench before an instrument board which contained a
bewildering array of dials, buttons and levers, was a short, bull-necked man.
He wore a close-cropped, bristling pompadour, a thin, fiercely upturned
moustache, and an immense pair of thick-lensed, horn-rimmed spectacles. A set
of headphones covered his ears, and his pudgy hands worked incessantly with
the levers, dials and buttons on the board before him. The only light in the
room came from a panel of frosted glass which was just above the instrument
board. On the panel, which the operator constantly watched, was a very clear
shadow picture of the living room I had quitted only a short time before, in
the home of Miss Van Loan.</p>

<p>From where I stood I could see Miss Van Loan and the pseudo Dr. Dorp seated
just as I had left them, while Rafferty, who was impersonating me, was staging
a quite lively wrestling match in the center of the room with the chair which
had proven so hostile toward me earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>At a sign from Dr. Dorp, we drew our weapons and tiptoed to the door. It was
locked, and the key was in place, but Hogan opened it quickly and silently
with a small tool which he carried for the purpose. Before he was aware of our
presence we had the operator surrounded and covered. The doctor jerked the
phones from his head, and said:</p>

<p>“Hands up, Mr. Hegel. You are under arrest.” His look of surprise and alarm
was quickly followed by a sullen frown as he thrust his pudgy hands aloft.</p>

<p>“Arrest? For what?” he demanded belligerently.</p>

<p>“Nivver mind for what, my old buckaroo,” said Hogan, snapping the handcuffs on
his wrists. “I’ve a warrant in me pocket that covers ivverything from
interferin’ wid the radio reception on the north shore down to attempted
murder. Come away wid yez now, and don’t try no shenanigans, or be the lord
Harry, I’ll quiet yez wid this gun butt...”</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>Some two hours later, having left Hegel in the care of the
proper authorities, we were gathered in the living room of the Van Loan
home&mdash;the girl, the two engineers, the two detectives, Dr. Dorp, and I. All
were seated but the doctor, who stood before the fireplace. He cleared his
throat and looked around with his well-known lecture-room air.</p>

<p>“Now that the author of the strange phenomena which have confronted us in this
house has been apprehended,” he said, “explanations, and such further
investigations as are needed to completely clear up the mystery, are in order.</p>

<p>“You are all aware that the manifestations we have witnessed were under the
control of an operator established in an old farmhouse eight miles west of
here, and that the mechanism he used was a powerful and complicated radio set.
In order that you may thoroughly understand how Ernest Hegel was able to make
inanimate objects react to our movements as if they were endowed with minds,
let me explain that he could both see and hear what was going on in this house
as well as if he had been here in person. Planted in this very room in such a
clever manner as to escape notice except by the most careful scrutiny, are
powerful lenses which acted as his eyes, and microphones which served as his
distance ears. If Miss Van Loan does not mind a slight mutilation of her walls
in the interests of our investigation, I will disclose one of each.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see them, doctor,” said Miss Van Loan.</p>

<p>The doctor took out his pocket knife and opened it. Then he walked to the wall
opposite us and scrutinized it very carefully. Presently he held the point of
the knife to a small spot which resembled thousands of other spots on the
mottled pattern of the wallpaper, and said:</p>

<p>“Can you see this opening?”</p>

<p>We all replied that we could not, and crowded around him. As we drew close to
it a small hole about the diameter of a lead pencil became visible by
concentration on the spot touched by the knife. Unless we had been
deliberately searching for it, it is probable that it would have gone entirely
unnoticed, due to its location on one of the dark spots in the pattern of the
paper itself.</p>

<p>“This,” said the doctor, “is one of Hegel’s eyes.” He lightly tapped inside
the hole with the point of his knife and we heard it click against some hard
substance. Then he cut a square of paper and plastering from around it,
disclosing a black box which bore a close resemblance to a small camera with a
tiny lens in front. Taking a small screwdriver from his pocket, he removed
the front of the box, the back of which was covered with row on row of small,
circular affairs which he described as photoelectric cells.</p>

<p>“Each cell,” he said, “responds, according to the strength of light or shade
which strikes it through the lens, with a different wave length. These various
wave lengths are combined and transmitted from a common antenna. At the
receiving station, the process is reversed, and this image is built up on
ground glass by various vibrating light beams. For a thorough description of
this process, which I will not go into here, I refer you to the book, ‘Radio
for All.’ There are four ‘eyes’ like this one in this room alone. Every other
room in this house is as thoroughly equipped.</p>

<p>“And now for the ears.”</p>

<p>He examined the wall until he found another hole, into which he thrust the
knife blade. Then he removed another square of wall paper and plaster,
revealing one of those instruments with which we were all familiar&mdash;the
microphone.</p>

<p>“As this instrument needs no explanation,” he said, “I will now show you how
our friend Hegel managed to lock, unlock, open and close doors from a distance
of eight miles.”</p>

<p>He walked to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>“This door,” he said, “shows no signs of having been tampered with in any way,
yet I am convinced that there are at least two electric wires connecting it
with the current which Hegel tapped somewhere in front of the meter&mdash;I have not
yet discovered where.”</p>

<p>With his screwdriver, he removed the bottom hinge, while we crowded around
him. Then he started to remove the top hinge, but found that the first screw
he tried would not turn. Abandoning it, he removed all the other screws, then
inserted the screwdriver beneath the hinge, and pried. The hinge came loose,
but revealed the fact that the screw had been soldered to the metal back, and
to a heavy wire which now protruded from the wall. The whole thing had been
insulated with electricians’ tape, and the block of wood in which it was
fastened had been cut out, surrounded with sealing wax, and replaced. He next
removed the other side of the hinge from the door, and found it similarly
connected and insulated, the wire leading to the interior of the door.</p>

<p>Having cut the wire with a pair of pliers, the doctor laid the door on its
side and removed the lock and latch. Both were controlled by an ingenious
arrangement of electromagnets. The return current, he found, was through
round-headed, insulated contact screws, one on the door, and one on the door
jamb against which it fitted.</p>

<p>He next turned his attention to the bottom of the door. It was evident at a
glance, that a long strip of wood had been removed, replaced with glue, sanded
and varnished. Using his screwdriver as a chisel, he pried up the strip of
wood, and removed from the cavity behind it a heavy bar of iron.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “if you will follow me to the basement I will show you the
mechanism which acted on this bar of iron, causing the door to open or close.”</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>We filed down into the basement behind him, and he led the way
to a point directly beneath the living room door. The ceiling was covered with
plasterboard, a block of which he removed. Fastened to the floor in a
semicircle was a string of large electro-magnets.</p>

<p>“All of these magnets,” he said, “were caused to act in their turns by
impulses of varying wave lengths which closed and opened their circuits.
Naturally they pulled the bar of iron although separated by two heavy layers
of wood, as there is no insulation which will stop magnetic waves, thus
closing or opening the door at the will of the operator. The poker and the
heavy overstuffed chair were caused to travel about the room in the same
manner, the latter probably having iron bars inserted in the legs, by
utilizing other electro-magnets fastened beneath the floor and concealed by
this plasterboard.</p>

<p>“While we are here we may as well clear up the mystery of the luminous
footprints, for I see the removal of this square of ceiling has already
disclosed a part of the mechanism. You will observe here, a glass tube, above
which there are two lead plates. The top plate is movable, and is connected
with an electro-magnetic device for moving it. In the bottom plate is cut in
miniature, the shape of a human footprint. The glass tube is what is known as
a Crookes Tube, and the rays which emanate from it when an electric connection
is established are known as X-rays. Although these rays are, in themselves,
invisible, some of them have the property of making certain substances
phosphorescent. The rays which have this property can be cut off by a lead
screen of the correct thickness. One of the substances which can be
rendered luminous is sulfid of zinc, and is probably the one used, although I
have not yet had an opportunity to verify this. The substance, whatever it may
be, has probably been ground into exceedingly minute particles and rubbed into
the rug above our heads. A luminous footprint can thus be made to appear on
the rug by the simple expedient of turning on the current in the Crookes Tube
and sliding back the upper plate in such a manner that the toe prints will
first be visible, then the ball of the foot, and finally the heel. I’m sure
that if we remove more squares of plasterboard we will find a row of these
contrivances about two feet apart, leading to a point beneath the center of
the room, where two of them will be found side by side. For the present,
however, we will go upstairs to continue our investigation in other
directions.”</p>

<p>When we were once more in the living room, the doctor asked for a stepladder,
and Riggs was sent to bring one. When he brought it, the doctor placed it in
the center of the room and climbed up to where the central lighting fixture
projected from the wall.</p>

<p>“In this fixture,” he said, “are concealed one of the sources of the icy
breath, and also the source of the ghastly and foul-smelling spectre which
rose from the center of the floor on two succeeding evenings. You will observe
that the entire fixture, central hemisphere and surrounding collar, appears to
be made from frosted glass. The central hemisphere from which the light
emanates is glass, but the surrounding collar is of metal covered with a white
substance. That white substance is common frost.”</p>

<p>So saying, he scraped off a quantity of the frost and handed it down to us for
our inspection.</p>

<p>“Please take special notice of the designs on this collar,” he said, “for they
are particularly well suited for the purposes for which our friend Hegel
intended them&mdash;a series of circles, each about an inch from the other, reaching
entirely around the collar. I will now do by force what the builder of this
device previously did by mechanical means, controlled by radio.”</p>

<p>He took the screwdriver and, reaching up, inserted the end and pried at one of
the circles. It came open, revealing the fact that it was a small hinged trap
door. What surprised us the most, however, was the fact that a small white
globe fell out of it and broke on the rug.</p>

<p>“Switch off the lights for a moment,” he said.</p>

<p>Someone pressed the light switch, and all of us saw the now familiar vision of
a spectre materializing from the floor.</p>

<p>“Turn them on,” he ordered.</p>

<p>They were turned on once more.</p>

<p>“The ghost,” he said, “is nothing more than a mixture of foul-smelling gases,
one of which is slightly phosphorescent. This mixture, as you will observe, is
visible in the dark but invisible in the light. The gas is imprisoned in small,
thin globes of ice which shatter when they strike the rug, and melt in a few
seconds, leaving no trace other than a few drops of water which quickly
evaporate or are absorbed by the rug fibres. These globes are kept in a small
refrigeration plant which is just above my head, and which is probably quite
thoroughly insulated against heat. The intense cold in this plant is produced
by a substance which is not new to science, but the use of which for this
particular purpose is quite new. The substance is frozen CO₂ or carbon
dioxide, and when expanded into a gas it is identical with the substance that
gives zest to soda water and bottled beverages. It has a temperature of 114°
below zero, Fahrenheit, and evaporates to a dry gas without going through the
intermediate liquid state with which we are familiar in most substances.</p>

<p>“The cold air and gas from this refrigerating chamber, when propelled into the
room by small, noiseless fans through others of these hinged openings which do
not contain the gas balls, creates the phenomenon of the icy breath. It can
also create the illusion of a light touch from a cold hand, as I have proved
experimentally. The slight breeze moving the small hairs on one’s hand or arm
gives the sensation of one having been lightly touched while the coldness of
the breeze makes it appear that one has been touched by something cold. The
closet, in which I came so near being asphyxiated and frozen to death, is
equipped with a similar refrigeration plant, and it is probable that we shall
find more of them which have not been used, in other rooms.</p>

<div class='vs20'></div>

<p class='ni'>“The matter of the lights going out and again being turned on
will be settled as soon as we can find the radio-controlled rheostat and
switch which operates them. Is everything clear?”</p>

<p>“You have not explained what it was which drove my dog mad,” Miss Van Loan
reminded him.</p>

<p>“Your dog,” he said, “had hydrophobia. As I found a bottle of the virus which
produces this disease in the house occupied by Mr. Hegel, I don’t think it at
all remarkable that the dog was infected. No doubt it was acquainted with and
friendly toward your cousin, who found an opportunity to inoculate it when it
was ranging on your estate. The queer behavior of the dog, thereafter, is
common to all animals that contract the disease. In my opinion the dog was
inoculated three or four days ago. It would certainly have died within a few
hours, had you not shot it when you did.”</p>

<p>“What I cannot understand,” said Mr. Brandon, the electrical engineer, “is how
Mr. Hegel found the time or opportunity to install this complicated array of
electrical equipment. Mr. Van Loan, I understand, had only been dead a little
more than a month.”</p>

<p>“I made a few investigations today which cleared up that point,” replied the
doctor. “It is a matter of common knowledge that Gordon Van Loan died from
cancer of the stomach. Mr. Van Loan was not aware that he had this disease,
although both his niece and nephew had been apprised of the fact nearly a year
before his death by the family physician. They had also been informed that an
operation would be fruitless and fatal, and were told almost to the day just
how long their uncle would live.</p>

<p>“Last winter, in the vain hope that he might better his condition, Gordon Van
Loan went to Florida for a three months’ stay, taking his two servants with
him. Some time before, the nephew had left in a huff after Mr. Van Loan, in a
fit of anger, had disclosed to him the contents of the will he had made. Being
in possession both of the knowledge of the will and the probable length of
time his uncle would live, Hegel laid his plans for winning the estate. Just
before Mr. Van Loan left for Florida, he visited him, saying that he was out
of a job and penniless, and asking that he might be given something to do in
order that he might earn some money. The house was badly in need of cleaning
and decorating, and, as he had good taste in this line, he was permitted to
oversee the work of papering, painting, and varnishing while his uncle was
away, asking in return only a very small salary and the privilege of rooming
in the house. His uncle turned over the keys of the house to him, paid him his
salary in advance, and established credit with a firm of decorators.</p>

<p>“Hegel’s supposed trip to Europe was, of course, only a blind to hide his
recent operations here. Are there any more questions?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Easton. “Now that Hegel has been apprehended, what can the law
do with him? What charges can be placed against him?”</p>

<p>“He will be charged with robbery, resisting an officer, and attempted murder.
You see he robbed a radio and camera shop after stealing a small truck, in
order to get equipment for this elaborate installation, which his slender
means would not permit him to buy. A police officer on night duty saw him just
as he was leaving the shop, but Hegel wounded him with a revolver shot, and
escaped. As he left fingerprints, and the stolen articles will be easy to
identify, there is no possible way for him to escape final and certain
conviction.”</p>
